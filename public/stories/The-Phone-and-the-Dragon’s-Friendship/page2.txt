Early the next morning, before the shop opened, Phony carefully wiggled free from his shelf and headed out. He rolled along the dusty path, past the village, and up the hill where Draco's cave waited. The entrance was grand and carved into the mountainside, with the sound of chirping birds and rustling leaves filling the air.

Inside the cave, Phony was awestruck by the glowing gems and the soft light they cast. It was like stepping into a dream. In the distance, he saw Draco, a magnificent emerald-green dragon with golden scales and eyes that sparkled like the sun. Phony's screen lit up in awe. "Hello! I'm Phony," he called out eagerly.

Draco turned with a warm smile, "Hello there, little friend. I am Draco. What brings you to my cave?"
