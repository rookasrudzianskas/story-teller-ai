Once upon a time in a bustling tech store, there lived a curious little phone named Phony. Phony, with its shiny silver body and cheerful face, sat on a wooden shelf, eagerly watching people as they entered and left the store. Phony's favorite time was at night when the shop was quiet, and he could dream about adventures and making friends.

One night, as Phony gazed out the window, he saw a trail of shimmering stars leading up to the hills beyond the town. "I wonder what’s out there!” he thought. Phony had always heard tales of a wise and gentle dragon named Draco, who lived in a sparkling cave in those hills. Phony's screen glowed with excitement. "I want to meet Draco and be friends!" he decided.
