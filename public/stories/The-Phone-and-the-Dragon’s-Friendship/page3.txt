Phony’s voice trembled with excitement, "I’ve always wanted to meet you and be your friend. I’ve heard many stories about you, and I wanted to see for myself."

Draco’s golden eyes softened with kindness. "I’d be honored to be your friend, Phony," he replied. "Come, let’s share stories and learn from each other."

From that day on, Phony and Draco became the best of friends. Phony would share the latest technology news, and Draco would tell ancient tales of magic and wonder. They spent many joyous hours together, exploring the world and finding new adventures. Phony had realized his dream to find a true friend, and Draco had found a companion who brought light to his world.

And so, Phony and Draco's friendship grew stronger with each passing day, showing everyone that friendship knows no bounds, even between a phone and a dragon.
