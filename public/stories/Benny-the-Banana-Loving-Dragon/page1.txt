Once upon a time, in a magical forest nestled between tall mountains, there lived a dragon named Benny. Benny wasn't like other dragons who loved to hoard gold and breathe fire. Benny had a peculiar fascination with bananas. He had shiny emerald green scales that shimmered like jewels under the sunlight. His big, kind eyes were a deep shade of orange, and his wings, lined with sparkling silver, spanned as wide as a house. Benny had a sleek tail with a heart-shaped tip, making him look both majestic and friendly.
