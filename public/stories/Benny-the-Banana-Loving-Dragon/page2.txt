Benny's home was a cozy cave at the edge of Banana Grove, where banana trees grew taller than the treetops. The grove was filled with the sweet scent of ripe bananas, and the trees always had bright yellow fruits hanging in clusters. Benny loved spending his days tending to the grove, carefully watering the trees and making sure every banana was perfect. His best friend, a mischievous monkey named Milo, often helped him. Milo had a playful grin, big brown eyes, and fur the color of honey. He wore a little red bandana around his neck and liked to swing from tree to tree.
