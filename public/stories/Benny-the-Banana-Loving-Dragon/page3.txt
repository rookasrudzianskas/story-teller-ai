One sunny afternoon, a group of adventurers stumbled upon the grove. They were amazed by the beauty and abundance of bananas but were even more awestruck when they met Benny. Instead of scaring them away, Benny offered them some bananas. The adventurers quickly became friends with the gentle dragon and Milo. They laughed, shared stories, and had a wonderful time feasting on bananas. From that day on, Benny's banana grove became a famous spot for adventurers seeking friendship and delicious bananas. Benny and Milo were happy to have so many new friends and lived joyfully in their beloved grove.
