Drago had sparkling emerald-green scales that shimmered in the sunlight and bright, golden eyes that twinkled whenever he smiled. His wings were large and strong, perfect for soaring through the skies, and his claws were shiny and sharp, but only used for picking fruits and veggies. Drago had a small, friendly snout with a few spots of silver on it from his adventures.
